<p>Welcome to Prroperties's technology platform. The Prroperties service and network (collectively, the "Service") are operated by Prroperties LLC, a Limited Liability Company, incorporated in the state of California (the "Company," "we," or "us"). (together with its affiliates, "Prroperties"). By accessing or using our website at www.Prroperties.com, including any subdomain thereof (the "Site"), you (the "User") signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these terms of service ("Terms of Service"), regardless of whether you are a registered member of the Service.</p>
<p>We are a technology platform that permits Accredited Investors (as defined below) and certain other persons to independently connect with issuers of securities relating to real estate investments. These Terms of Service govern your access and use of the Site and all content, services, and/or products provided through the Site (collectively, the "Service"). Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Service on the Site. If you violate any of these Terms of Service (which include by reference Prroperties's Privacy Policy) or otherwise violate an agreement between you and us, the Company may terminate your membership, delete your profile and any content or information that you have posted on the Site and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Service or the Site (or any portion, aspect or feature of the Service or the Site), at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
<p>In addition to these Terms of Service, you may enter into other agreements with us or others that will govern your use of the Service or related services offered by us or others. If there is any contradiction between these Terms of Service and another agreement you enter into applicable to specific aspects of the Service, the other agreement shall take precedence in relation to the specific aspects of the Service to which it applies. As used herein, "Users" means anyone who accesses and/or uses the Site.</p>
<p>Changes to these Terms of Service</p>
<p>We may make changes to these Terms of Service from time to time. If we do this, we will post the changed Terms of Service on the Site and indicate at the top of this page the date the Terms of Service were last revised. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service or the Site after we have made any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>This Site is intended solely for Users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and any registration by, use of or access to the Site by anyone under 18 is unauthorized, unlicensed, and in violation of these Terms of Service. By using the Service or the Site, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and that you agree to and abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service. If you violate any of these Terms of Use, or otherwise violate an agreement between you and us, or for any other reason, the Company may terminate your membership, delete your profile and any content or information that you have posted on the Site and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Service or the Site (or any portion, aspect or feature of the Service or the Site), at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice, including without limitation if it believes that you are under 18. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your membership.</p>
<p>The portion of our Service (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein are available only to certain qualified, registered and authorized users. Such portions of our Service and the Site may thus not be available in all jurisdictions or to all Users.</p>
<p>Only "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with a valid User ID and password, are authorized to access such services and web pages relating to offerings conducted under Regulation D of the Securities Act (such persons being "Accredited Investors"). In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. In some cases, you may be required to provide supporting documents to issuers that provide proof that you are an Accredited Investor. Such authorization may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening. Your failure to provide any information and documentation requested to confirm your status as an Accredited Investor will be cause for Prroperties to immediately discontinue your use of the Service by preventing your access to the Website and the Service. Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where Prroperties is not authorized to provide such information or services.</p>

<p>"Tier II" Investment opportunities registered pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act, including real estate investment trusts and other funds sponsored by one of our affiliates, are offered only to "qualified purchasers" as defined in Regulation A. "Qualified purchasers" include: (i) "accredited investors" under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D and (ii) all other investors so long as their investment in our common shares does not represent more than 10% of the greater of their annual income or net worth (for natural persons), or 10% of the greater of annual revenue or net assets at fiscal year-end (for non-natural persons).</p>
<p>Securities Offerings</p>
<p>Private placements of securities offered on the Website have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.</p>
<p>Prroperties LLC ("Prroperties") is an exempt reporting adviser that serves as manager to several special purpose entities/private placements, each pursuing a venture capital strategy. Prroperties's clients are the special purpose entities it advises and not the investors in such entities.</p>

Renesent Manager's clients are the REIT entities and single-purpose funds, and not the investors in the REITs or the single-purpose funds in their capacities as such.</p>
<p>Investment overviews on the Site contain summaries of the purpose and principal business terms of the investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions contained in the investor document package relating to the such investment opportunity.

You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will promptly notify Prroperties in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you. Prroperties is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.</p>

<p>Because Prroperties operates largely on the Internet, it is necessary for you to consent to transact business with us online and electronically. Before you decide to do business electronically with Prroperties, you must satisfy the following computer hardware and software requirements: access to the Internet; an email account and related software capable of receiving email through the Internet; a web browser which is SSL-compliant and supports secure sessions, such as Internet Explorer 5.0 or above and Netscape Navigator 6.0 or above, or the equivalent software; and hardware capable of running this software.</p>
<p>Prroperties generally receives all payments, and makes all disbursements, through electronic funds transfers (ACH transfers) using the bank (or other financial institution) account information you provide to us. You authorize such bank or other financial account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize Prroperties to make any and all investment disbursements, to such account. You agree to provide Prroperties updated information regarding your bank or other account upon Prroperties's request and at any time that the information earlier provided is no longer valid.</p>
<p>As part of doing business with Prroperties, you must also consent to our giving you certain disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the email address you provide to us. By agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications, notices, contracts, and agreements, including any IRS Form 1099 or other tax forms, schedules or information statements, arising from or relating to your registration as an investor on our Site, any investments you may make, your use of this Service, and the servicing of any investment you may make (each, a "Disclosure"), from Prroperties or any service provider we may use. An IRS Form 1099 refers to any Form 1099 or other Form, Schedule or information statement, including corrections of such documents, required to be provided pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations and that may be provided electronically (each, an "IRS Form 1099"). The decision to do business with Prroperties electronically is yours. This document informs you of your rights concerning Disclosures.</p>
<p>Your consent to receive Disclosures and transact business electronically, and our agreements to do so, applies to any transactions to which such Disclosures relate, whether between you and Prroperties. Your consent will remain in effect for so long as you are a User and, if you are no longer a User, will continue until such a time as all Disclosures relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a User have been made.</p>
<p>You may not withdraw such consent as long as you have outstanding any investments made through the Site. If you have no outstanding investments made through the site and wish to withdraw consent to doing business electronically, we will terminate your registered user account with us.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing by you and us, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Terms, or any breach thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or such arbitration body as required by law, rule or regulation, and a final judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator in California. Such arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Prroperties or you may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this arbitration provision.</p>
