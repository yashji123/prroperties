<p>The Company Platform is a web-based communications platform which enables connections between Clients and Taskers. &ldquo;Clients&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain task services (&ldquo;Tasks&rdquo;) from Taskers and are therefore clients of Taskers, and &ldquo;Taskers&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Tasks for Clients. Clients and Taskers together are hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Users.&rdquo; If you agree on the terms of a Task with another User, you and such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>TASKERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURES, OR FRANCHISEES OF COMPANY. COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM TASKS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM TASKS.

<p>The Company Platform only enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of Tasks. Company is not responsible for the performance or communications of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks, Taskers, Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users, or of any ratings provided by Users with respect to each other. Company makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Tasks requested or services provided by, or the communications of or between, Users identified through the Company Platform, whether in public, private, or offline interactions or otherwise howsoever.</p>

Although Company may perform Identity Checks, Company is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of Identity Check information or any information provided through the Company Platform. When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety, data, and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don&rsquo;t know. Company will not be liable for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Company Platform.</p>

Where you enter into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity and to bind that entity to this Agreement. You further represent and warrant that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, the Happiness Pledge, and the Privacy Policy in order to access and use the Company Platform. You hereby warrant and represent that you will respect the privacy (including without limitation private, family and home life), property and data protection rights of Users and that you will not record (whether video or audio or otherwise) any Task or any interaction by or with any User and/or Company in connection with the Company Platform without the prior written consent of Company and/or the relevant User, as applicable. You further represent and warrant that you will fulfill the commitments you make to other Users, including paying/receiving payment through the Company Platform, performing the Task(s) agreed upon as between the Tasker and Client, communicating clearly and promptly through the chat thread and/or responding to invitations promptly, being present and/or available at the time you agree upon with your Tasker or Client as the case may be, and only utilizing the third party payment processing system specified or approved by us to make or receive payment for services provided through the Company Platform.

<p>registration or as arises during your use of the Company Platform. Taskers additionally represent and warrant that you will provide timely, high-quality services to your Clients, you will only offer and provide services for which you have the necessary skills and expertise, and you will provide the services safely.</p>
<p>3. Contract between Clients and Taskers</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that a legally binding contract (the &ldquo;Service Agreement&rdquo;) is formed when you agree on the terms of a Task with another User. The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the Company Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Tasker and their Client to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement, including this Section 3, and do not expand Company&rsquo;s obligations or restrict Company&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Tasker (or anyone else supplied by the Tasker), nor will it create an employment relationship between the Client and the Tasker or any such person. Company&rsquo;s role is restricted solely to acting as a limited payment collection agent for the Tasker to facilitate payment on behalf of the Tasker through the Company Platform in respect of Tasks they perform. In acting as the limited payment collection agent for particular Tasks on the Company Platform, Company disclaims any other agency or authority to act on behalf of the Tasker, and assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Tasker, either within or outside of the Company Platform. Where approved in advance by the Client, the Tasker is not obligated to personally perform the Services. Before any Task services are performed by any assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel engaged by the Tasker (collectively &ldquo;Assistants&rdquo;), the Tasker shall require any such individuals to become fully registered, oriented and verified Taskers on the Company Platform. A Tasker&rsquo;s failure to comply with this provision by bringing an Assistant who is not a registered Tasker could lead to removal from the Company Platform. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of such Assistants, including without limitation the payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses of Assistants, if any, and for all required and applicable state and federal income tax withholdings as to the Tasker and all persons engaged by the Tasker in the performance of the Task services. While using the Company Platform, Clients, in their sole discretion, determine whether they will be present or not when a Task is performed and/or completed. Clients who elect not to be present when a Task is performed and/or completed agree that if someone other than them (i.e. spouse, roommate, friend, etcetera) is present when the Task is performed, they are appointing that person as their agent (&ldquo;Client&rsquo;s Agent&rdquo;) and the Tasker may take and follow direction from the Client&rsquo;s Agent as if such direction was given from the Client him or herself.</p>
<p>The Client shall pay their Tasker directly for completed Task services through the Payment Service Provider retained by the Company (&ldquo;PSP&rdquo;) as indicated on the Company Platform at the rates agreed to by the parties in the Service Agreement. Each party agrees to comply with the Service Agreement and this Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Task. Both parties agree to notify Company of any disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate any dispute informally via Company representatives for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any</p>

<p>proceeding. Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account or Task pending the resolution of any dispute.</p>
<p>4. Billing and Payment</p>
<p>Users of the Company Platform contract for Tasks directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Tasks or services. Payment for Task services through the Company Platform is made directly from the Client to the Tasker via the PSP, and not by Company. Company is not obligated to pay Tasker for Client&rsquo;s failure to pay for services. Users of the Company Platform will be required to provide their credit card and/or bank account details to Company and the PSP. Taskers are responsible for invoicing their Clients within 24 hours of the work being performed, even if the Task is not completed in its entirety or is designed as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Task (the &ldquo;Invoice&rdquo;), which will include (i) the pricing terms of the Task agreed with and provided by a Tasker (&ldquo;Task Payment&rdquo;), (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by a Tasker in connection with the Task, (iii) any tip or gratuity, if applicable, (iv) the service charge Company assesses as payable for the use of the Company Platform, variable based on the Task Payment amount, and (v) the platform fee (sometimes referred to as Trust &amp; Support Fee), which is used to offset Company&rsquo;s cost of providing Users with customer support, providing the Happiness Pledge set forth in Section 12, and other various business objectives, and (vi) cancellation fees, if applicable. Taskers will be responsible for paying (i) registration fees (applicable to Tasker registrants), (ii) cancellation fees, if applicable and (iii) repayment of erroneous payments. Clients may also be charged credit card processing fees equal to three percent (3%) of the aggregate expense amount if expenses related to a Task individually, or Tasks in the aggregate over a 30-day period, exceed $300.00. Taskers may be required to register with the PSP, agree to terms of service of the PSP, and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP (the &ldquo;PSP Services Agreement&rdquo;). By accepting these Terms of Service, each Tasker agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to, the PSP Services Agreement. Please note that Company is not a party to the PSP Services Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Services Agreement are the parties to the PSP Services Agreement and that Company has no obligations or liability to any Tasker or other party under the PSP Services Agreement. To help prevent fraud and safeguard User information from the risk of unauthorized access, Company and/or the PSP may validate an account before activation. As part of the account validation, a very temporary charge is placed on the account associated with the User and then refunded within 1-3 business days. Due to the difference in PSP and credit card issuer requirements, this temporary charge may vary between $0.01 US to $5000.00 US, depending on the estimated value of the Task and expenses. When Client receives confirmation through the Company Platform or via email that a Task has been completed, Client automatically authorizes the PSP to process the Invoice. Users may be charged a one-hour cancellation fee through the PSP if you book (or accept) a Task, but cancel it before the scheduled time for performance. Company reserves the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, upon request from Client or Tasker, or upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the Company Platform, to (i) place on hold any Task Payment, out of pocket expenses, and/or tip or gratuity (if applicable) or (ii) refund or provide credits, or arrange for the PSP to do so. Task Payment and fees must be paid through the PSP as indicated on the Company Platform, as well as outlined below section</p>

<p>5. Contests, Gift Cards, and Promotional Codes</p>
<p>Company may from time to time provide certain promotional opportunities and contests to Users. All such promotions will be run at the sole discretion of Company, and can be activated, modified, or removed at any time by Company without advance notification. The liability of any of Company&rsquo;s corporate partners pursuant to such promotional opportunities and contests shall be limited pursuant to Section 16 of these Terms of Service. Company gift cards (&ldquo;Gift Cards&rdquo;) and promotional codes (&ldquo;Promo Codes&rdquo;) may be available and can be used to pay Task Payments and Company service charges and platform fees in part or in full, but may not be used to pay for reimbursement of out of pocket expenses or tips associated with a Task provided through the Company Platform.</p>
<p>1. Promo Codes</p>
<p>Promo Codes are an offer by Company to reduce the amount a Client has to pay in relation to a Task Payment, service fee, and/or platform fee. Promo Codes will not affect the amount of the Task Payment a Tasker ultimately receives. You agree that you will use Promo Codes in accordance with the terms of the Promo Code. Company reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of a Promo Code by you or any other User in the event that Company determines or believes that the use or redemption of a Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or this Agreement.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &mdash; IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND Company CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND Company TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p>
<p>(a) Informal Negotiations</p>
<p>To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and Company (each a &ldquo;Claim&rdquo; and collectively &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;), you and Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those Claims expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. This pre-arbitration negotiation shall be initiated by providing written notice to the other party&mdash;including a brief written statement describing the name, address, and contact information of the notifying party, the facts giving rise to the Claim, and the relief requested. You must send such written notice to Vekser, 514 N. California Ave. Beaumont CA 92223 Attention: Legal. If necessary to preserve a Claim under any applicable statute of limitations, you or Company may initiate arbitration while engaging in the informal negotiations. During this pre-arbitration negotiation, all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties. After a good faith effort to negotiate, if you or Company believe a Claim cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party, as specified in the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;).</p>
<p>(b) Agreement to Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND Company MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU (EXCEPT THOSE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED BELOW) IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.</p>
<p>This agreement to arbitrate contained in this Section 18 (&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives the termination of this Agreement and your relationship with</p>

<p>Company. Claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy whether based on past, present or future events arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof); the Company Platform, services, or Tasks; your relationship with Company; the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User Account or this Agreement; payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you; any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law; compensation, breaks and rests periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, emotional distress; any promotions or offers made by Company; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Company and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. If there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any Claim (including questions about the scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement), you and Company agree that this threshold dispute shall be delegated to the arbitrator (not a court) and that the arbitrator shall have initial authority to resolve such threshold disputes, except as expressly provided below.</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND Company ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WHICH BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>
<p>(c) Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</p>
<p>Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Company agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Company and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Company ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (&ldquo;CLASS ACTION WAIVER&rdquo;). Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to Private Attorney General Act Claims brought against Company, which are addressed separately in Section 18(d) below.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules (as defined below), disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 20">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>(ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>(d) Representative PAGA Waiver</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and Company agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (&ldquo;PAGA&rdquo;), California Labor Code &sect; 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and Company agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, &ldquo;Representative PAGA Waiver&rdquo;). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.</p>
<p>(e) Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration</p>
<p>The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&ldquo;AAA Consumer Rules&rdquo;), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. You and Company agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA. As part of the arbitration, both you and Company will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator will decide the</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 21">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:</p>
<p>(i) If Company initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Company will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.</p>
<p>(ii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, Company will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>(iii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, Company shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and the Client or Tasker shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which they provide Services to Clients, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.</p>
<p>(iv) Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).</p>
<p>(v) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Unless you and Company agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Company and a Tasker will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between Company and a Client will take place in the county in which you received Task services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.</p>

However, you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Agreement.

<p>EXHIBIT B Pick-up, Delivery and Moving Services</p>
<p>The Company Service additionally uses its mobile site platform to connect persons seeking help with the relocation, messengering, moving or delivery of personal items (&ldquo;Users&rdquo;) with persons who are willing and able to use their vehicle to drive the items and assist the User with the</p>
<p>moving and delivery of such personal items to their final destination (&ldquo;Haulers&rdquo;). For purposes of these Terms of Use, these moving services shall hereinafter be referred to as the &ldquo;Services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Company does not itself, nor will it provide the transportation or moving services for the Users. Instead, the Company works to connect Users with Haulers, as appropriate. After the Company has matched a User with a Hauler, the User must decide whether or not to accept the Services from the Hauler contacted through the Company Service, and the Hauler must decide whether or not to offer to provide the Services as requested through the Company Service. Such decisions are made in the User&rsquo;s or Hauler&rsquo;s sole discretion. The Company offers the Company Service to match Users and Haulers, but does not nor does it intend to provide the Services, and, as such, has no liability for any Services provided to any User by any Hauler using the Company Service.</p>
<p>Payments and Pricing</p>
<p>All payments are due immediately following completion of the Services and will be facilitated by the Company and our third-party payment processing service using the User&rsquo;s preferred payment method designated in his or her account. The Company will receive a commission of 35% from each payment for the Service, as well as a flat cargo insurance fee of $2.50 per Service. The remainder of the payment is then transferred to the applicable Hauler&rsquo;s account. All payments made are non-refundable. In the event that a User cancels a request for Service 48 hours prior to reservation date made on the Company Service, the User will be charged a $25 fee. All pricing will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to change pricing, including the commission percentage, at any time and from time to time without advance notice. The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer promotions and discounts to any Users or Haulers, but has no obligation to do so. All payments will be processed using third-party payment service. All payments to a Hauler will be made via direct deposit to the checking or savings account specified in the Hauler&rsquo;s account settings. The Company does not handle the collection of payments and therefore will have no liability to you relating to payment processing.</p>
<p>Section 1. Representations and Warranties of Haulers</p>
<p>By using the Company Service, each Hauler represents, warrants, and agrees that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>● &nbsp;Hauler is at least 21 years old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>● &nbsp;Hauler has the ability to lift and carry items that may be up to or exceed 50 pounds.</p>
</li>
