California Ave. Beaumont CA 92223 and their affiliates, parents, and subsidiaries (collectively, Vekser the “Company” or “us”) and/or participating in the Company’s “Project Advisor Services”, you (“you” or “User”) hereby expressly acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any future amendments and additions to this Agreement as we may publish from time to time (this “Agreement” or “Terms and Conditions”). This Agreement governs your use of our services and platform that facilitates communications between Users and independent home service providers for Project Advisor Services offered through the Company, as it may be modified, relocated and/or redirected from time to time.
If you do not agree to accept and be bound by this Agreement, you must immediately stop using the Company’s services. The Company's acceptance is expressly conditioned upon your assent to this Agreement in its entirety. If this Agreement is considered to be an offer by us, acceptance is expressly limited to this Agreement. By using the Company’s services, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are at least 18 years old, are at least of the legally required age in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts; and (ii) you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and that you will so abide. Where you enter into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity and to bind that entity to this Agreement. Except as set forth in preceding sentence, the right to use the Company’s services is personal to you and is not transferable to any other person or entity.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IN PARTICULAR, PLEASE REVIEW THE MUTUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 28.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1.PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES
The Company, through its technology platform, makes available certain home services labeled as “Project Advisor Services” to individuals seeking to obtain home services (“Requesters”) that the Company fulfills using independently-established home service providers customarily engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business of providing the services requested (“Service Providers”). Through Project Advisor Services, you will pay for a portion of your home service upfront (the “Upfront Payment”) and you will pay for the remainder of the service upon Project Completion (as defined below). The Company and Requester may agree upon a change to the cost of the Project Advisor Services prior to Project Completion, and Requester may be charged an additional Upfront Payment.
2.NO SCREENING FOR PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES
a.For Project Advisor Services, potential Service Providers are not screened through a background check, license check, credit check, or any other formal screening procedure. THE COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTEE THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS ON PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES HAVE A CLEAN CRIMINAL RECORD OR APPROPRIATE LICENSES.
b.THE COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER INCLUDING SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.
3.PRICING AND PAYMENT FOR PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES
a.Pricing: Upon booking, we will display to Requester estimated pricing or a range of estimated pricing for their requested Project (the “Estimate”). The Estimate is not binding on either party and does not represent agreed-upon final pricing. After booking, Requester and the Company will agree to final pricing in a separate, signed invoice that sets forth both the pricing for and scope of the Project (the “Invoice”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Requester and the Company
do not execute an Invoice, any post-booking written agreement between the parties about pricing and/or scope shall be binding on the parties (with email sufficing).
b.Payment: Upon booking, we will charge the Requester’s credit card for a deposit (the “Deposit”). Upon Project Initiation (as defined below), we will charge the Requester's credit card for the Upfront Payment(s), and upon Project Completion, we will charge the Requester's credit for the remainder of the amount owed in addition to all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees, expenses or applicable taxes associated with the Project Advisor Service, and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge any credit card on file in the Requester's account with the Company or other previously approved payment methods for such amounts. Provided, however, that for certain projects, we may charge an additional amount after Project Initiation but prior to Project Completion. We will use third party services to process credit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving the Company (or a third-party payment processor on the Company's behalf) permission to charge any on-file credit card, debit card, or other previously approved methods of payment for fees that you owe the Company. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Project Advisor Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Company at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester's credit card for an ordered or completed Project Advisor Service transaction. Project Initiation is defined as when either the Company or the Service Provider takes a substantial step in relation to the Project Advisor Service, including but not limited to (i) the Company paying any non-refundable deposit to a Service Provider, and/or (ii) a Service Provider drafting plans, applying for planning permission, ordering materials, seeking any permit, and/or arriving at the address of the Requester to begin the Project Advisor Service. After the Company receives written confirmation from both the Requester and Service Provider that the Project Advisor Service has been completed, as reasonably determined by the Company
(“Project Completion”), we will mark the Project Advisor Service as completed; provided, however, that Project Completion shall be deemed to have occurred if the Requester does not provide a response to the Company within three (3) days of the Service Provider providing written confirmation of such.
c.Refunds and Credits: Except for the Happiness Guarantee , no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Project Advisor Service provided (other than taxes based on the Company's income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to the Company or third parties, then the Company may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to the Company or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (i) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (ii) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (iii) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (iv) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.
5.HAPPINESS GUARANTEE FOR PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES
a.Project Advisor Services are eligible for the Happiness Guarantee as set forth at http://Vekser.com/guarantee, which is incorporated herein by reference.
6.PRICE MATCH PROMISE

Projects that are eligible for the Price Match Promise will have language indicating such eligibility. If there is no reference to a Price Match Promise, that project is not eligible for the Price Match Promise.

Requirements for Submitting a Price Match Claim:
Your project must be booked through Vekser.com or Vekser.com to qualify for a Price Match, and the lower price must be from a service professional in the Vekser or Vekser network. Your claim must be submitted prior to you paying the 10% down payment for your booked project, and it must include a quote and detailed statement of work from the Vekser or Vekser service professional offering a lower price. The statement of work must include the service professional’s contact information. The statement of work must mirror the details of your booked Project Advisor Service project (i.e. in scope, materials, location of home, and timing). To submit your claim, email project@Vekser.com – or call # (415) 212-5211.

Guidelines and limitations:
We reserve the right to contact the service professional to verify their quote. If we are not able to verify the lower price, we may decline the claim. The Company may deny claims if it believes that the Price Match Promise is being intentionally abused or manipulated to circumvent its intent. A claim may be invalidated if you make any changes to your project after the claim is submitted and approved. Void where prohibited by law. The Company may modify or discontinue the Price Match Promise or these terms and conditions at any time in our sole discretion, with or without notice.
7.SAVINGS MEMBERSHIP.
If you book a Project Advisor Service subject to these terms, you may be automatically enrolled in a complimentary Savings Membership.

28.MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
a.Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past, present, or future, between you and the Company, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or arising out of this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and the Company may attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally (the “Informal Negotiations”) before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for any notices under this section is your email address and/or physical address that you have provided to the Company. The Company's address for such notices is: legal@Vekser.com and/or by mail to the Legal Department, 514  N. California Ave. Ste. 0 Beaumont CA 92223.
b.Arbitration. If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations, you and the Company agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”). This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website (www.adr.org). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If you are unable to pay such costs, the Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” described in Section d below.
c.Excluded Disputes. You and the Company agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our intellectual property rights; (2) individual claims in small claims court; (3) any claim that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (4) any claim for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief on the ground that without such relief the arbitration provided in this Arbitration Agreement may be rendered ineffectual.
d.WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION. You and the Company agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (“Class Action Waiver”). Regardless of anything else in this Arbitration Agreement and/or the applicable AAA Rules or AAA Consumer Rules, the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.
e.Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding. A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.
f.Severability. You and the Company agree that if any portion of this section entitled “Mutual Arbitration Agreement” is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of this Section 28 will be given full force and effect.
29.GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; TIME LIMITATION FOR CLAIMS
Except for the Arbitration Agreement in Section 28, which is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and except as may be prohibited by the law of the State in which you primarily reside, this Agreement is governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. For all Disputes not subject to arbitration, You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within the county of Riverside, California. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Site or this Agreement shall be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred.
