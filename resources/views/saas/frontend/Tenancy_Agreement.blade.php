<p>Furniture: _____________ Storage: _____________</p>
<p>Parking: _____________</p>
<p>2.

<div class="column">
<p>4. LATE PAYMENTS: Tenant and Owner agree that Owner will sustain costs and damage as a result of any late payment of rent but that it will be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damage. Therefore, the following sum represents a reasonable and fair estimate by Owner and Tenant of the actual damage that would be sustained. Tenant agrees to pay a late charge equal to US $120 for any payment of rent not received by Owner within seven (7) calendar days of the Due Date. Owner may not impose interest on the nonpayment of the late charge or impose the late charge more than once for the particular late payment of Rent. The provision for payment of a late charge does not constitute a grace period, and Owner may serve a Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit on the day after the Due Date. Owner and Tenant agree that Tenant paying rent late on four (4) separate occasions within any twelve (12) month period shall constitute habitual late payment of rent and may be considered a just cause for eviction.</p>
<p>5. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING: Tenant shall be permitted to assign this Agreement to any affiliate or subsidiary by giving Owner five (5) calendar days advance written notice of any such assignment. Owner agrees that Tenant may sublet the Premises or any portion of the Premises and</p>

<p>10. SUBTENANT SECURITY DEPOSITS: Security deposits from Subtenants shall be placed in Tenant&rsquo;s account and, if held in Tenant&rsquo;s account, pay from such account all interest on subtenants&rsquo; security deposits if required by local law or ordinance.

<p>11. MAINTENANCE: Tenant shall, at Tenant&rsquo;s expense, at all times maintain the Premises, furnishings and appliances, if any, in a clean and good condition and shall surrender the same upon termination of tenancy in the same condition as received (excepting normal wear and tear and other items detailed in any addendums to this Agreement).

Tenant shall contract for or undertake the making of all necessary repairs and the performance of all other necessary work for the benefit of the Premises including all required alterations to properly maintain the Premises. Tenant shall make no improvements, alterations, or repair work costing more than $500.00 without the prior authorization of the Owner. Should Owner elect to undertake any repair work, Owner must complete the work within seventy-two (72) hours of committing to undertake the work, unless the repair is essential to habitability and requires immediate remedy under applicable law. Tenant reserves the right to withhold rent due to Owner&rsquo;s delay. Tenant is authorized to make emergency repairs in order to keep the Premises habitable according to Department of Real Estate regulations. Tenant shall take reasonable precautions to safeguard the Premises and its contents; however, it is agreed that Tenant shall not be held liable for the cost of replacement of Owner&rsquo;s personal property in case of theft or vandalism.

<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>any property held in common within a larger association (condo HOA&rsquo;s, TICs), the yard or lawn. Any maintenance expenditure by Tenant will either be invoiced separately or be deducted from a following month&rsquo;s rent.</p>
<p>12. INSPECTION CONTINGENCY: This Agreement is contingent upon the Tenant having the right to engage an inspector to determine the structure, condition, utilities access, lighting conditions, neighborhood traffic, current and planned neighborhood construction, neighborhood safety and noise levels of the Premises and Building as well as the behavior of occupants, tenants, neighbors, contractors, vendors, managers, agents, and owners of the Building and other units in the Building, if any. Tenant will also inspect any association (HOA&rsquo;s, TICs, etc.) rules and regulations, including restrictions on leasing, advertising, and installing lockboxes or digital locks. The inspection shall be conducted and the contingency concluded within 21 days of the lease start date. The inspection report and association rules and regulations must be satisfactory to Tenant and should Owner and Tenant fail to reach an agreement on repairs/replacements to be made and/or abatement of rent due by Tenant, all deposit monies will be immediately refunded and all Agreement obligations considered null and void.</p>
<p>13. CONTRACTS/SERVICES: Tenant may contract, hire, supervise and/or discharge firms and persons, including utilities, required for the operation and maintenance of the Premises. Tenant may perform any of these duties through attorneys, agents, employees, or independent contractors, and shall not be responsible for their acts, omissions, defaults, negligence, and/or costs of same.</p>
<p>14. DAMAGES TO PREMISES: If the Premises is damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, or from any other cause so as to render them uninhabitable and therefore destroyed, the tenancy is terminated, unless restored pursuant to law.</p>

ENTRY AND INSPECTION: Owner shall give Tenant reasonable notice of the intention of Owner/Owner&rsquo;s agent to enter the Premises and shall enter only during normal business hours, unless otherwise agreed by Tenant. For purposes of this Paragraph, normal business hours shall be defined as 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, every day of the week. Tenant may not place any unreasonable restrictions upon such entry. If, however, Owner reasonably believes that an emergency exists (such as a fire or flood) which requires immediate entry, such entry may be made without prior notice to Tenant. If Tenant has, after written notice to cease, continued to deny Owner access to the Premises, as required by law, such failure is a substantial breach of this Agreement and is a just cause for eviction. If the Premises or the Building is required by any government agency or insurer to undergo inspections, repairs or alterations, Tenant agrees to cooperate fully with Owner so that all such inspections, repairs or alterations are made in as expeditious and efficient a manner as possible.</p>
<p>16. SMOKING: Smoking of any substance is not permitted in the Premises or in any common area of the Building. Tenant shall inform his or her guests or invitees of this smoking prohibition. Any breach of this provision by the Tenant shall be deemed a material breach of the Agreement and may be just cause for eviction. Tenant shall promptly notify Owner in writing of any incident where smoke is migrating into the Premises from sources outside of the Premises. Tenant is hereby informed that there may be rental units in the Building where smoking is permitted. Owner shall not be liable for any damages or injury to Tenant&rsquo;s health or personal property, or any other person&rsquo;s health or personal property, occurring on the Premises or any part thereof, in connection with the use of tobacco or tobacco products by any other resident or occupant in the Building.</p>

<p>Removal</p>

If Tenant sublets the Premises to a Subtenant, Tenant may allow Subtenant to place some or all utilities in Subtenant&rsquo;s name. Nothing contained herein prevents Tenant from passing through to Subtenant utility costs as provided by law. If Owner pays for or provides Gardening, Landscaping, and/or Spa/Pool service, such service should be provided by professionally certified or licensed vendors approved by Tenant. If utilities or services required by this Agreement to be provided by Owner are deemed unsatisfactory to Tenant, Tenant may, at its sole discretion, pay for, provide, and charge back to Owner the cost of such utilities or services, including any additional fees or penalties charged by providers of such utilities or services, as well as an additional $500.00 reconnection fee.</p>

<p>20. TENANT RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>A. Communication with Owner: Tenant agrees to maintain communication with Owner regarding developments and interests related to the Premises.

<p>B. Limitation of Liability: Tenant is not responsible in any manner for: (1) Personal injury to Owner or any subtenant resulting from acts of third parties</p>
<p>(2) Loss or damage of personal or real property due to vandalism, theft, or freezing water pipes If any loss, damage, or injury to the Premises or any person is caused by Tenant or Tenant's negligence and such loss or damage is covered and compensable under any insurance policy related to the Premises, Owner agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to hold Tenant liable only for Owner's deductible in such a policy and any other out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
<p>C. Insurance: Tenant shall carry, at Tenant's own expense, commercial liability insurance as may be necessary or appropriate.

<p>OTHER NOTICES</p>
<p>A. LEAD DISCLOSURE: Many homes and apartments built before 1978 have paint that contains lead (called lead-based paint). Lead from paint chips and dust can pose serious health hazards if not taken care of properly. The law requires that Tenant receive certain information before renting pre-1978 housing. By signing this Agreement, Tenant represents and agrees that Owner has provided Tenant with such information, including, but not limited to the EPA booklet entitled, "Protect Your Family From Lead In Your Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B. ASBESTOS: The Premises may contain asbestos or have original construction materials that contain asbestos. Asbestos is known to exist in the following locations: N/A (Copies of available reports, if any, are attached hereto for your reference and information.) Damaging or disturbing the surface of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) may increase the risk of exposure. Therefore, Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s guests, contractors, or invitees shall not allow any action which may, in any way, disturb ACMs or any part of the Premises that may contain asbestos or ACMs. Tenant shall notify Owner immediately if Tenant knows or suspects that an ACM has been disturbed or if Tenant becomes aware of any ACM that is showing signs of deterioration.</p>
<p>C. INFORMATION ABOUT BED BUGS: Bed Bug Appearance: Bed bugs have six legs. Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about 1/4 of an inch in length. Their color can vary from red and brown to copper colored. Young bed bugs are very small. Their bodies are about 1/16 of an inch in length. They have almost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it appear to be a different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals. Bed bugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden. Life Cycle and Reproduction: An average bed bug lives for about 10 months. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bed bugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days. Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding. Bed Bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten. A person&rsquo;s reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts caused by the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all. Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation include:</p>
<p>&bull; Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.</p>
<p>&bull; Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.<br /> &bull; Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&bull; Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping. However, some people do not show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed bugs may have fed on them.<br /> For more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National Pest Management Association. Tenant shall report any potential bed bug infestation promptly to Owner at the contact information provided on the signature page of this Agreement</p>
<p>D. ABANDONED PERSONAL PROPERTY: State law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the tenant, subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general, these costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging</p>
<p>to you was left behind after you moved out.</p>
